## What I learn ?

In this section I will document what I learn from any lessons 


- **JS Drump Kit**
  - listen to transition end event (transitionend)
  - use data-* attribute 
  - use kbd tag which represents the user keyboard input, voice input, or any other text entry device input

</br></br></br>

- **CSS + JS Clock**
  - setInterval function 
  - practise JS Date
  - .style.transform

</br></br></br>

- **CSS variable and JS**
  - learn new event => change, mousemove
  - use documentElement.style.setProperty(prop, value);

</br></br></br>

- **Array Cardio Day 1**
  
   *practice array methods*
    - filter => 
      -  creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
      -  does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - map => 
      - creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
      - calls a function once for each element in an array.
      - does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - sort =>
      - sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
      -  overwrites the original array.
      -  sorts the elements of an array.
    - reduce =>
      - returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
      -  does not execute the function for empty array elements   
  
</br>

- **Flex Panel Gallery**
  - you can listen to the same element with multiple EventLister  
  - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;

</br>

- **Type Ahaed**
  - odd & even
    - syntax div:nth-child(odd/even)
    - Odd and even are keywords that can be used to match child elements whose index is odd or even (the index of the first child is 1
  - The <span>perspective</span> property is used to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.
  - The <span>rotateX</span>() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around the abscissa (horizontal axis) without deforming it.
  - The <span>fetch</span>() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages. The request can be of any APIs that returns the data of the format JSON or XML.
  - The then() method in JavaScript has been defined in the Promise API and is used to deal with asynchronous tasks such as an API call
  - A <span>promise</span> is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
  - The <span>json</span>() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
  - The \B metacharacter matches NOT at the beginning/end of a word.

 - **Array Cardio Day 2**
   - .some() => function returns a truthy value for at least one element in the array. Otherwise, false.
   - .every() => true if the callbackFn function returns a truthy value for every array element. Otherwise, false.
   - .find() => The value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, undefined is returned.
   - .findIndex() => method returns the index (position) of the first element that passes a test.
  
  </br>

  - **Fun With HTML5 Canvas**
    - <sapn>getContext() </sapn>=> returns a drawing context on the canvas.
    - <span>canvas.width</span> => return the width <br><span>canvas.height</span> => return the height 
    - <span>innerWidth</span> returns the width of the window's layout viewport. The interior height of the window—the height of the layout viewport—can be obtained from the <span>innerHeight</span>  property. 
    - <span>strokeStyle</span> => sets or returns the color, gradient, or pattern used for strokes.
    - <span>lineJoin</span> => sets or returns the type of corner created, when two lines meet.<br>bevel|round|miter
    - <span>lineCap</span> =>  sets or returns the style of the end caps for a line. <br> butt|round|square
    - <span>lineWidth</span> =>  sets or returns the current line width, in pixels.
    - The
    - <span offsetX >offsetX</span> property returns the x-coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the target element.<br>Tip: To get the y-coordinate, use the <span>offsetY</span> property.
    - Mouse events
      - <span>mousedown</span> => The event occurs when the user presses a mouse button over an element.
      - <span>mousemove</span> => The event occurs when the pointer is moving while it is over an element.
      - <span>mouseup</span> => The event occurs when a user releases a mouse button over an element
      - <span>mouseout</span> => The event occurs when a user moves the mouse pointer out of an element, or out of one of its children
