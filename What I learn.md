## What I learn ?

In this section I will document what I learn from any lessons 


- **JS Drump Kit**
  - listen to transition end event (transitionend)
  - use data-* attribute 
  - use kbd tag which represents the user keyboard input, voice input, or any other text entry device input

</br></br></br>

- **CSS + JS Clock**
  - setInterval function 
  - practise JS Date
  - .style.transform

</br></br></br>

- **CSS variable and JS**
  - learn new event => change, mousemove
  - use documentElement.style.setProperty(prop, value);

</br></br></br>

- **Array Cardio Day 1**
  
   *practice array methods*
    - filter => 
      -  creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
      -  does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - map => 
      - creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
      - calls a function once for each element in an array.
      - does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - sort =>
      - sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
      -  overwrites the original array.
      -  sorts the elements of an array.
    - reduce =>
      - returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
      -  does not execute the function for empty array elements   
  
</br>

- **Flex Panel Gallery**
  - you can listen to the same element with multiple EventLister  
  - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;

</br>

- **Type Ahaed**
  - odd & even
    - syntax div:nth-child(odd/even)
    - Odd and even are keywords that can be used to match child elements whose index is odd or even (the index of the first child is 1
  - The perspective property is used to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.
  - The rotateX() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around the abscissa (horizontal axis) without deforming it.
  - The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages. The request can be of any APIs that returns the data of the format JSON or XML.
  - The then() method in JavaScript has been defined in the Promise API and is used to deal with asynchronous tasks such as an API call
  - A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
  - The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
  - The \B metacharacter matches NOT at the beginning/end of a word.
  
</br>

 - **Array Cardio Day 2**
   - .some() => function returns a truthy value for at least one element in the array. Otherwise, false.
   - .every() => true if the callbackFn function returns a truthy value for every array element. Otherwise, false.
   - .find() => The value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, undefined is returned.
   - .findIndex() => method returns the index (position) of the first element that passes a test.
  
  </br>

  - **Fun With HTML5 Canvas**
    - getContext() => returns a drawing context on the canvas.
    - canvas.width => return the width <br>canvas.height => return the height 
    - innerWidth returns the width of the window's layout viewport. The interior height of the window—the height of the layout viewport—can be obtained from the innerHeight  property. 
    - strokeStyle => sets or returns the color, gradient, or pattern used for strokes.
    - lineJoin => sets or returns the type of corner created, when two lines meet.<br>bevel|round|miter
    - lineCap =>  sets or returns the style of the end caps for a line. <br> butt|round|square
    - lineWidth =>  sets or returns the current line width, in pixels.
    - The
    - <span offsetX >offsetX property returns the x-coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the target element.<br>Tip: To get the y-coordinate, use the offsetY property.
    - Mouse events
      - mousedown => The event occurs when the user presses a mouse button over an element.
      - mousemove => The event occurs when the pointer is moving while it is over an element.
      - mouseup => The event occurs when a user releases a mouse button over an element
      - mouseout => The event occurs when a user moves the mouse pointer out of an element, or out of one of its children

  - **Must know Dev Tools tricks**
    - *Practice console functions*
  
  <br>

  - **Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes**
    - event.shiftkey  => returns a Boolean value that indicates whether or not the "SHIFT" key was pressed when a mouse event was triggered.

  - **Custom Video Player**

    - The currentTime property sets or returns the current position (in seconds) of the audio/video playback.
    - The play()/pause() method starts/stops playing the current audio/video.

  - **Key Sequence Detection**
    - Installing the Cornify script

  - **Slide in on Scroll**
    -  The read-only scrollY property of the Window interface returns the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically.
    This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled horizontally from the scrollX property. 
    - The read-only innerHeight property of the Window interface returns the interior height of the window in pixels, including the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if present. 
    - The HTMLElement.offsetTop read-only property returns the distance of the outer border of the current element relative to the inner border of the top of the
