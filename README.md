## What I learn ?

In this section I will document what I learn from any lessons 


- **JS Drump Kit**
  - listen to transition end event (transitionend)
  - use data-* attribute 
  - use kbd tag which represents the user keyboard input, voice input, or any other text entry device input

- **CSS + JS Clock**
  - setInterval function 
  - practise JS Date
  - .style.transform

- **CSS variable and JS**
  - learn new event => change, mousemove
  - use documentElement.style.setProperty(prop, value);

- **Array Cardio Day 1**
  
   *practice array methods*
    - filter => 
      -  creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
      -  does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - map => 
      - creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
      - calls a function once for each element in an array.
      - does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - sort =>
      - sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
      -  overwrites the original array.
      -  sorts the elements of an array.
    - reduce =>
      - returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
      -  does not execute the function for empty array elements   
  

- **Flex Panel Gallery**
  - you can listen to the same element with multiple EventLister  
  - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;
