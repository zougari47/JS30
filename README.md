## What I learn ?

In this section I will document what I learn from any lessons 


- **JS Drump Kit**
  - listen to transition end event (transitionend)
  - use data-* attribute 
  - use kbd tag which represents the user keyboard input, voice input, or any other text entry device input

- **CSS + JS Clock**
  - setInterval function 
  - practise JS Date
  - .style.transform

- **CSS variable and JS**
  - learn new event => change, mousemove
  - use documentElement.style.setProperty(prop, value);

- **Array Cardio Day 1**
  
   *practice array methods*
    - filter => 
      -  creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
      -  does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - map => 
      - creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
      - calls a function once for each element in an array.
      - does not execute the function for empty elements.
      -  does not change the original array.
    - sort =>
      - sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
      -  overwrites the original array.
      -  sorts the elements of an array.
    - reduce =>
      - returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
      -  does not execute the function for empty array elements   
  

- **Flex Panel Gallery**
  - you can listen to the same element with multiple EventLister  
  - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;






// *odd & even 
//      div:nth-child(odd/even)
//      Odd and even are keywords that can be used to match child elements whose index is odd or even (the index of the first child is 1).

// *rotate x 
// The rotateX() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around the abscissa (horizontal axis) without deforming it.
// , *fetch(), 
// The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages. The request can be of any APIs that returns the data of the format JSON or XML. 
// *then ,
// The then() method in JavaScript has been defined in the Promise API and is used to deal with asynchronous tasks such as an API call.
//  *promis
//  A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
// *.json() 
// The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON
// presective
// \B in The regex
// The \B metacharacter matches NOT at the beginning/end of a word.
